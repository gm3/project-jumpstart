# Project Jumpstart

Project Jumpstart is a Python script designed to streamline the creation of new development projects. It automates the setup of a typical project structure, allowing you to focus on the actual development right from the start.

## Features

- Generates a basic project structure for Web/React projects and VRM projects.
- Option to include a CLI component.
- Easy to extend with more project templates.
- Open to contributions for additional project configurations.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run `python3 project_jumpstart.py` from the command line.
3. Follow the prompts to select your project type and additional options.
4. Your project structure will be created in the designated directory.

## Project Structure

- `frontend/`: Contains the React application structure (if applicable).
- `backend/`: Contains the backend server structure (if applicable).
- `vrm-project/`: Contains VRM specific files and directories (if applicable).
- `data_processing/`: For scripts and modules related to data processing.
- `tests/`: To hold test cases and testing configurations.
- `docs/`: For project documentation.
- `scripts/`: For utility scripts and automation.
- `.github/`: For GitHub workflows and issue templates.

## Extending

To add a new project template:
1. Create a new `.py` file in the `templates/` directory with your project structure logic.
2. Import and integrate the new template into the main script following the existing pattern.
